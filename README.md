# SAVE IMAGE FROM CLIPBOARD

As the name suggest, this program is to save image from clipboard to a destination folder, and it increments the filename so i don't have to replace previous image or name it manually

Example: 

```
$env:SIFCB_COUNTER_FILE_PATH = "C:\Users\user\.sifcb"
$env:SIFCB_SAVE_DIR = "C:\Users\user\OveDrive\Pictures\Clipboard"
sifcb
```

But i use it with ahk script so i can save the file just from a key press

[Example ahk script](/sifcb-example.ahk)
```

```
